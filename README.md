# Location-Reminder
An Android application that reminds the user when they arrive to some location.

<ul>
<li>The user can select the radius they want to be notified</li>
<li>Do-no-Disturbed for geofences</li>
<li>'Names for places' are being stored in the background. If I start typing the name of a previously used place in the
place's name field, a drop down menu will give me the option to re-select a previously used place</li>
<li>When the user clicks on the notification, they can see the distance to the target place, and also a compass showing them
where the reminder place is.</li>
<li>English and Greek locales.</li>
</ul>
There is also one unfinished feature. The list with the reminders can be ordered by distance to the device, but the list fragment does not implement any sort of location tracking.

<p>This app was developed as part of one of the modules of my MSc in Human-Computer Interaction.</p>
